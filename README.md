# Web Developer Learning Journey

Welcome to my GitHub repository! This is where I document my progress and showcase the projects I build as I learn web development.

## About Me

Hi! I'm Edmon Nacimento, a passionate beginner learning the art of web development. I am currently focusing on mastering HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and eventually working my way through more advanced technologies like React, Node.js, and databases. I started this journey to build a career in web development and improve my skills in building interactive, responsive, and dynamic web applications.

## What This Repo Contains

- **Learning Projects**: These are small, hands-on projects where I experiment with different aspects of web development. You will find basic static web pages, form submissions, and interactive features like to-do lists or simple games.
- **Code Challenges**: As part of my learning, I solve challenges from platforms like [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/), [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/), and [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/).
- **Tutorials & Notes**: Sometimes, I add code snippets, notes, or guides to help myself and others learn. Feel free to browse these resources if you're on a similar learning path.

## Technologies I’m Learning

- **HTML**: The structure of the web.
- **CSS**: Styling web pages to look beautiful and responsive.
- **JavaScript**: Adding interactivity and functionality to web pages.
- **React** (learning soon): Building dynamic user interfaces.
- **Node.js & Express** (future goals): Learning server-side JavaScript and backend development.
- **Git & GitHub**: Version control and collaboration.

## My Learning Goals

- Build more interactive web applications.
- Understand and implement responsive design principles.
- Master JavaScript and start working with front-end frameworks like React.
- Build and deploy full-stack web applications.
- Contribute to open-source projects.
